# KNN with scikit-learn

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=1)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("accuracy: {:.2f}".format(knn.score(X_test, y_test)))
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)
```
accuracy: 0.77

???
We import train_test_split form model selection, which does a
random split into 75%/25%.
We provide it with the data X, which are our two features, and the
labels y.

As you might already know, all the models in scikit-learn are implemented
in python classes, with a single object used to build and store the model.

We start by importing our model, the KneighborsClassifier, and instantiate
it with n_neighbors=1. Instantiating the object is when we set any hyper parameter,
such as here saying that we only want to look at the neirest neighbor.

Then we can call the fit method to build the model, here knn.fit(X_train,
y_train)
All models in scikit-learn have a fit-method, and all the supervised ones take
the data X and the outcomes y. The fit method builds the model and stores any
estimated quantities in the model object, here knn.  In the case of nearest
neighbors, the `fit` methods simply remembers the whole training set.

Then, we can use knn.score to make predictions on the test data, and
compare them against the true labels y_test.

For classification models, the score method will always compute
accuracy. 

Just for illustration purposes, I also call the predict method here.
The predict method is what's used to make predictions on any dataset.
If we use the score method, it calls predict internally and then
compares the outcome to the ground truth that's provided.
